# GO Struct
- It is the collection of members of different datatypes into single variable
- It is same as structure in c and same as creating objects as in javascript
- we use type and struct to declare the structure and it is declared in global scope
- we initialize it inside the functions

- Syntax:
    ```
        type structName struct {
            variable1 dataType
            variable2 dataType
            variable3 dataType
            variable4 dataType
        }
    ```
