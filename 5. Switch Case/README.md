# Go switch case
- It is same as C, C++, Java, etc
- It selects one of many code blocks to be executed
- The only difference is that there is no break statement

- Syntax:
    ```
        swtich expression {
            case x:
                // code block
            case y:
                // code block
            case z:
                // code block
            ...
            default:
                // code block
        }
    ```
